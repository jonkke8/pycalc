# pycalc

Just a calculator I'm trying to make in Python, as my first project since I wanted to start learning python.
I'm keeping this public just because I want to.

## VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS!!
### This is my first project, so terrible code is expected. Although I don't know why anyone would download this..
